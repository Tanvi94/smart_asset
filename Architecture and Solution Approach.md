# Smart Asset — A

## Context

Frank Energie operates in the intraday electricity market where energy is traded per 15-minute (per quarter) delivery quarter.  
Quantity is in MWh, price in EUR/MWh.

This service receives live market order updates, maintains an internal order book, and continuously re-optimizes a charging plan for EV fleet — deciding *when* and *how much* to charge each group at the lowest possible cost.

## EV Fleet Charging Groups

| Group | Charging Window | Energy Need (MWh) | Max Power (MW) |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| A     | 00:00 – 08:30  | 5                 | 2              |
| B     | 00:00 – 11:00  | 10                | 3              |
| C     | 13:00 – 18:00  | 4                 | 1              |
| D     | 13:00 – 21:00  | 20                | 6              |
| E     | 17:30 – 22:00  | 5                 | 2              |
| F     | 17:30 – 23:59  | 15                | 5              |

Each group has a fixed time window, a total energy requirement, and a max power draw per quarter.

## Core Components

### 1. Order Book (`OrderBook.kt`)

Price-time priority matching engine, per delivery period.

- BUY order comes in → sweep ASK side from lowest price up (as long as ask ≤ buy price)
- SELL order comes in → sweep BID side from highest price down (as long as bid ≥ sell price)
- Matched quantity cancels out; remainder rests at the incoming price level
- Aggregates at same price level (no individual order tracking needed)
- Separate book per 15-min delivery period

### 2. Charging Optimizer (`ChargingOptimizerService.kt`)

For each group, rank available quarters by cheapest ask price, allocate up to `maxPower × 0.25h` per quarter until the energy need is met.

Triggered on every order update. Accounts for energy already purchased (`chargedSoFar`).

Emits steering signals to car groups indicating charge power per quarter.

### 3. Purchase Tracker (`PurchaseTrackerService.kt`)

Records every executed purchase (matched BUY). Calculates:
- Total MWh purchased
- Total cost (EUR)
- Weighted average price (EUR/MWh)

### 4. Steering Signal Client (`SteeringSignalClient.kt`)

File-backed mock. Logs every steering signal: group, quarter window, charge power.

### 5. Market Order Client (`MarketOrderClient.kt`)

File-backed mock. Logs every order sent to market: order ID, group, delivery window, side, quantity, price.

|--------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/orderupdate` | Submit a market order update. Triggers matching + re-optimization. |
| GET    | `/api/market/overview` | Returns all quarters with highest bid and lowest ask.              |
| GET    | `/api/purchases/average` | Returns total MWh, total cost, and weighted avg price/MWh.         |
| GET    | `/api/health` | Health Check.                                                      |

### Issues & solutions

#### Removed the duplicate optimization call so the optimizer only runs once per order update.
#### Let the optimizer place market BUY and SELL orders based on changes between the new and previous plan.
#### Pass the chargedSoFar data into the optimizer so it accounts for energy that has already been purchased.
#### Record purchases when the optimizer executes a BUY order instead of when an external order is matched.
#### Keep track of the previous optimization plan so the optimizer can calculate the required BUY/SELL changes on each re-optimization.
#### Updated/Added unit tests
